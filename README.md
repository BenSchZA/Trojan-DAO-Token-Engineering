## Motivation

This research and development project envisions and describes an easy-to-use community-specific digital currency, that is governed through a Moloch-fork DAO. Users can mint, burn, and hold, and participate in its governance, without the constraints of banks. Tokens are contributed to a communal pool governed by the DAO (TrojanPool.sol) whenever the token is minted from the smart contract or transferred from one address to a different address. The proposed implementation would operate on a public blockchain and would be backed by Ether. The system is meant to be fully decentralized, and participatory, and operate on-chain without any need for a centralised point of control. If the Trojan DAO is a "bank-as-performance" then its currency is its "currency-as-performance". A currency that is not "bought" or "sold" in the conventional sense but rather it is participated in.

Furthermore, the method described can be forked and the depolyment parameters such as % DAO tax and Bonding Curve parameters adapted to scenarios such as creating a fundraising mechanism for Moloch-fork DAOs, or Moloch-Continuous Organizations, and other novel crypto-economic experiments and use-cases.


## Goals

* Provide creative communities with a usable digital currency based on blockchain technology, as a means of fuelling shared goals and exchanging resources across borders without the mediation of banks.

* Participants are incetivised to be involved / contribute through the DAO structure.

* Provide a source of revenue for the DAO through the economic activities that its currency generates, via "DAO tax".

* Used in community events and activities.

* Anti-Speculative: In our implementation, the currency value is pegged to ETH, is backed by a verifiable reserve of ETH that guarantees a minimum value. Future implementations can chose to deploy with different bonding curve parameters, such as in the case for BC fundraising scenarios.

* Making the flow of capital more efficient through the system unlocks collaborative value and benefits all stakeholders. Creating a circular economy between participants, and between participants and the "outside world". 

* Autonomous and immutable: There is no "killswitch" or "backdoor". The only way to withdraw Ether from the smart contract is to burn the token. The creator, nor anybody else, can ever access this reserve pool of ether unless burning tokens, thus guaranteeing a minimum value for each token.

Long Term vision:

Art invades finance - Using blockchain technology, artists involved should be able to exchange value between communities and sustain collaborative practices without the restraints of national borders and capital controls, and without the interference of banks, due to the significant efficiency unlocked in building and operating crypto-economical systems that encode shared values.

## Contract Structure

`TrojanToken.sol` is an ERC20-compliant token contract with a built-in bonding curve. This token is used as the "approved token" for the Trojan DAO main contract. TROJ tokens can be minted through the contract, which uses a bonding curve as an automated market maker. The smart contract accumulates Ether when participants mint the token and it distributes Ether when participants burn it.  

'TrojanPool.sol' is a modified version of Moloch's Pool contract, a follow-on funding contract that mirrors the investments of the DAO. In our example implementation, the minting process is subject to a 2% DAO tax, where the tax amount is deposited into the Trojan Pool. Burning tokens similarly is taxed 3% to the DAO. Transfers of the token are subject to a 1% "redistribution" tax, whereby the tax is redistributed to all the token holders. 

In our example implementation, we built off the "Sparkle" token, which in turn was inspired by Bomb Token (BOMB) and Ampleforth (AMPL). However in "Sparkle" the "creator tax" is sent directly to an individual's ethereum address. Our implementation represents a significant imrpovement from the above: the revenue generated through the token's taxes is sent automatically to a pool governed by a DAO so as to be collectively distributed by the participants towards projects of mutual benefit, rather than being directed to any one individual's ethereum address.  

This project demonstrates that the bonding curve based token deployed together with a modified version of MolochPool.sol can be used to automatically grant a Moloch DAO with additional funding through the minting and burning of the token.

## Token-economic Simulations
CadCAD simulations

Scenarios simulated: mint, burn, and transfer.

Further negative tests and edge case tests need to be done.

## TODOs
* The `TrojanDao.sol` contract depends on the `TrojanToken.sol` contract, which depends on the `TrojanPool.sol` contract, which depends on the `TrojanDao.sol` contract. To work around this circular dependency, we had to add a `setTrojanPool` function. This is horrible for security purposes.
* The `TrojanToken.sol` contract needed to bootstrap the creator with tokens, in order to make testing easier. This should also be fixed for production.
* The TrojanToken contract can deposit funds into the Pool, but it cannot exit them. One way to exit the shares is by making a proxy contract that can receive a grant from the Trojan DAO and then call a function in the TrojanToken contract that will exit the funds.
* The UI of the DAO (Moloch fork) needs to integrate the TrojanToken methods.
* Explore the possibility of altering the ‚Äúredistribution tax‚Äù code so that this amount is spread evenly between holders rather than relative to holdings (more like a "UBI").
* Run more robust tests with cadCAD, using the results to fine-tune the ‚Äútax policies‚Äù of the token.
